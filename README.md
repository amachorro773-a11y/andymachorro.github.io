  **Cyclistic: Data-Driven Strategies for Membership Growth**\
  High-Level Overview:\
  Conducted a comprehensive analysis of 5.6 million bike-share trip records to identify behavioral differences between casual riders and annual members. By    leveraging SQL for large-scale data processing and Tableau for geospatial visualization, I identified a distinct "Leisure Segment" that peaks on weekends    with double the average ride duration of commuters. I developed a three-pillar strategic plan—including a new "Weekend Explorer" membership tier—designed    to convert users into predictable, recurring revenue streams.
