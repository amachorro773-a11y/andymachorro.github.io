Cyclistic: Data-Driven Strategies for Membership Growth
- Conducted a comprehensive analysis of 5.6 million bike-share trip records to identify behavioral differences between casual riders and annual members.       Using SQL and Tableau, I identified a distinct "Leisure Segment" that peaks on weekends with double the average ride duration of commuters. I developed      a three-pillar strategic plan, including a new "Weekend Explorer" membership tier designed to convert users into predictable, recurring revenue streams.
